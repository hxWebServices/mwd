        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I started out in the year 2000, registering or transferring domains for real estate websites, and then setting up the infrastructure for those domains on both DNS and IIS servers. I did that for many hundreds of domains. I've been developing websites for the past 7 years.

        <img class="musicSkills-img" src="images/musicSkills.png" alt="Music skills" width="300">
        <h3>Musician</h3>
        <p>I've been playing music with <a href="https:slograss.com">SloGrass</a> for over 30 years. We've recorded 4 CDs, and performed all over the Central Massachusetts area. I also sang with the <a href="https://www.freiburger-bachchor.de/content/">Freiburger Bachchor</a>, the <a href="https://salisburysingers.org/">Salisbury Singers</a>, and the <a href="https://www.musicworcester.org/the-worcester-chorus/">Worcester Choru</a>s.</p>

      <img class="spiritualSkills-img" src="images/spiritualSeekerSkills.png" alt="Spiritual Seeker Skills" width="300">
      <h3>Spirtual Seeker</h3>
      <p>My Grandfather was a Unitarian minister. I have a BA in Literature from <a href="https://www.miu.edu/">Maharishi International University</a>, where daily meditation is a cornerstone of the curricula. There's no end in sight. As John Wooden put it, "It's what you learn after you know it all that counts."</p>

      <img class="mtClimberSkills-img" src="images/mountainClimberSkills.png" alt="Mountain Climber Skills" width="300">
      <h3>Mountain Climber</h3>
      <p>Ok. So it's on my bucket list. I plan to climb all of <a href="https://www.outdoors.org/trip-ideas-tips-resources/plan-your-trip/nh-4000-footers">New Hampshire's 48 4000 footers</a> by the time I'm 77. So far, I've climbed 7 or 8. </p>

      <img class="schoolbusDriverSkills-img" src="images/schoolbusDriverSkills.png" alt="Schoolbus Driver Skills" width="300">
      <h3>School Bus Driver</h3>
      <p>I've driven a school bus, off-and-on, since I was a student at UMass in Amherst, where I drove an inter-campus bus. I also drove a school bus in <a href="https://mass.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/iml04.soc.ush.civil.boston/boston-desegregation/">Boston - 1974</a>. Were it not for Covid-19, I'd be driving today.</p>

      <img class="handymanSkills-img" src="images/handymanSkills.png" alt="Handyman Skills" width="300">
      <h3>Handyman</h3>
      <p>I've got the tools to have built 2 decks, one 10'x16' shed, and one attached, 24'x28' garage with 2 second floor bedrooms above it.</p>

      <p class="contact-message">Please a<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6mpklll">MUSE</a> me right back. Tell me a tale. I like MUSEic. I like MUSEums. Homer begins both the Iliad and the Odyssey like this, "Sing in me, Muse, and through me tell the story&nbsp;&hellip;" Now, go to that Kingdom of Heaven within, where the MUSES hang out, and bring me back a story. Make me forget about today until tomorrow.
